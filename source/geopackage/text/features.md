# [Features](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#features)

Vector feature data are geographic entities including conceptual ones
such as districts, real world objects such as roads and rivers, and
observations. (An *observation* is an act that results in the estimation
of the value of a feature property, and involves application of a
specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process
chain. A temperature at a given geographic location provided by a sensor
is an example of an observation.) For vector feature data, there is one
additional required table: `gpkg_geometry_columns`. Features are stored
in the user-defined data tables identified by the `table_name` values in
`gpkg_contents` (one table per row).

## [gpkg_geometry_columns](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#_geometry_columns)

The `gpkg_geometry_columns` table describes the geometry for a
particular Features table. Each feature table must have a corresponding
row in this table. The required columns in this table are:

-   `table_name` and `column_name` where the geometries are stored
-   `geometry_type_name`
    <http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#geometry_types_core>
-   `srs_id` the spatial reference system (see previous page)
-   `z` and `m` are flags to indicate 3D/4D applications (Z values are
    for height/elevation/depth and M values are reserved for other types
    of domain-specific measurements)

## [User-defined Data Tables](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#feature_user_tables)

Features are stored in user-defined data tables. Each features table has
exactly one geometry column, a BLOB. (The structure of this BLOB is
described [here](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#gpb_format).) The
[OGC Simple Features geometry
types](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#geometry_types_core) are the
supported geometry types. Other than the geometry column and a primary
key, the schema of a features table is up to the implementer. Properties
(text, integer, or real) provide additional information about each
feature. The GeoPackage standard has an [example
schema](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#example_feature_table_cols).

The [Schema Extension](extensions/schema.html) can be used to describe
columns in more detail than just their name.
