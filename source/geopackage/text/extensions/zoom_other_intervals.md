# [Zoom Other Intervals](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#extension_zoom_other_intervals)

This extension allows the use of tile pyramids with zoom levels that are
separated by something other than a power of 2. This can be useful for
certain types of raster data as described in this [blog
post](http://geopackage.blogspot.com/2015/11/powers-of-two-scale-sets.html).

## gpkg_extensions

Add a row to this table for each tile pyramid that does not have tile
matrices separated by powers of two as described in Table 1.

## gpkg_tile_matrix

When using this extension, the `pixel_x_size` and `pixel_y_size` can
differ by arbitrary amounts. One approach is to have the pixel sizes for
the highest zoom level match the native resolution of the raster data as
closely as possible and for the next highest zoom level to have
significantly higher pixel sizes, perhaps matching the pixel size of a
tile matrix from a more commonly used tile matrix set. This maximizes
image quality and reduces wasted space.
