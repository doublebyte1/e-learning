# [WKT for Coordinate Reference Systems](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#extension_crs_wkt)

This extension allows the use of the \"[Well-known text representation
of coordinate reference
systems](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html)\"
format (OGC 12-063r5, also known as CRS WKT2) to describe SRSs.

## gpkg_extensions

If using this extension, add a row to this table as described in Table
1.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Column             Value
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------
  `table_name`       `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys`

  `column_name`      `definition_12_063`

  `extension_name`   `gpkg_crs_wkt`

  `definition`       <http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#extension_crs_wkt>

  `scope`            *read-write*
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 1: `gpkg_extensions`

## gpkg_spatial_ref_sys

When this extension is in use, an additional column called
`definition_12_063` is added to this table. If software is creating or
updating a GeoPackage, it is expected to populate this column when it
adds an SRS. For compatibility reasons, it should also populate the
original (`definition`) column if possible (note that this is not
possible for all SRSs).

When reading a GeoPackage, client software is expected to prioritize
`definition_12_063` column over `definition`. If the software is unable
to read `definition_12_063` (i.e., it does not recognize the extension)
or that column is unpopulated, then it may fall back to using
`definition`.
