# Using the SQLite Application

Let\'s have a look at two example of GeoPackage files. Both files can be
downloaded from [the ETS
website](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-gpkg12/tree/master/src/test/resources/gpkg).
The files include:

-   *states10.gpkg* which contains vector feature data of US states and
    their attributes
-   *bluemarble.gpkg* which contains tile matrix sets of imagery.

To have a look at the structure of the files, download the files and
open them using the basic SQLite3 command-line utility.

-   on Windows SQLite3 has to be downloaded and installed from
    [here](https://sqlite.org/download.html).
-   on Ubuntu/Debian SQLite3 has to be installed using
    `sudo apt-get install sqlite3` or downloaded from
    [here](https://sqlite.org/download.html).
-   on Mac OS X, SQLite3 is pre-installed on newer versions and can be
    opened from the Terminal application or downloaded from
    [here](https://sqlite.org/download.html).

First run the following command `sqlite3 states10.gpkg` from the
terminal to open the states10.gpkg GeoPackage.

Once the SQLite3 application is running, list the tables in the
GeoPackage using the following command `.tables`. Notice that the names
of tables contained in the database are listed.

Now close the SQLite3 application by running the following command
`.quit`

Next, run the following command `sqlite3 bluemarble.gpkg` from the
terminal to open the bluemarble.gpkg GeoPackage.

Once the SQLite3 application is running, list the tables in the
GeoPackage using the following command `.tables`. Notice that the tables
are different from those that are in the states10.gpkg GeoPackage. This
is because the states10.gpkg file contains vector features only, whereas
the bluemarble.gpkg file contains tile matrix sets of imagery.

Now close the SQLite3 application by running the following command
`.quit`

A screenshot showing the steps and outputs is presented below.

Most of the tables are optional and only required for specific types of
datasets. That is why the bluemarble.gpkg database has some tables that
are not in the states10.gpkg database.
