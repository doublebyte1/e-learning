# Using the QGIS Application

There are several different ways to create and read a GeoPackage. Most
of the implementing software products have their own unique way of
supporting the handling of a GeoPackage. In this chapter we will show
how a GeoPackage can be read using the free and open source QGIS
application that can be found at <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/>.

In QGIS, open the states10.gpkg file, through the vector file loader
button.

Once QGIS has loaded the GeoPackage, it will display US state
boundaries. As a GeoPackage reader, QGIS is able to read the geometries,
spatial reference system and other geospatial content.

Now we will have a look at the feature properties. Right click on the
layer name (which is displayed as statesQGIS) and select Open Attribute
Table from the pop-up menu.

The properties of all features in the statesGIS dataset are displayed in
an attribute table. The data can now be queried and modified like any
other feature dataset in a desktop GIS.
