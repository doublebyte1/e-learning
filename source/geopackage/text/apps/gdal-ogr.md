# Using the GDAL/OGR library

There are alternative ways of accessing a GeoPackage, including through
use of other prorgamming languages and libraries. One of the software
libraries that offers this ability is the free and open source
Geospatial Data Abstraction Layer (GDAL) and its vector toolkit, OGR.
GDAL offers C, C++ and Python bindings that allow it to be imported into
a variety of applications.

To build and install GDAL on Windows, Linux or Mac OS X, the source code
can downloaded from [here](http://www.gdal.org/usergroup0.html).

For a quick start, GDAL 1.11 is also installed during the installation
of QGIS.

An example Python script for reading a GeoPackage using GDAL 1.11 is
below. The source code has been adapted from
[here](http://gdal.org/1.11/ogr/ogr_apitut.html). When the program runs
it prints out the values of feature properties.

``` python
import sys
import ogr
# First open a handle on the GeoPackage.
ds = ogr.Open( "/home/ogckm/Downloads/states10.gpkg" )
# If the file handle is null then exit
if ds is None:
    print "Open failed.\n"
    sys.exit( 1 )
# Select the dataset to retrieve from the GeoPackage and assign it to an layer instance called lyr.
# The names of available datasets can be found in the gpkg_contents table.
lyr = ds.GetLayerByName( "statesQGIS" )
# Refresh the reader
lyr.ResetReading()
# for each feature in the layer, print the feature properties
for feat in lyr:

    feat_defn = lyr.GetLayerDefn()
    # for each non-geometry feature property, print its value
    for i in range(feat_defn.GetFieldCount()):
        field_defn = feat_defn.GetFieldDefn(i)

        if field_defn.GetType() == ogr.OFTInteger:
            print "%d" % feat.GetFieldAsInteger(i)
        elif field_defn.GetType() == ogr.OFTReal:
            print "%.3f" % feat.GetFieldAsDouble(i)
        elif field_defn.GetType() == ogr.OFTString:
            print "%s" % feat.GetFieldAsString(i)
        else:
            print "%s" % feat.GetFieldAsString(i)
    # Confirm whether there is a geometry property
    geom = feat.GetGeometryRef()
    if geom is not None and geom.GetGeometryType() == ogr.wkbMultiPolygon:
        print "has a geometry property"
    print "\n"

ds = None
```

Note that GDAL 2.0 uses a different set of classes for accessing vector
data. We have used GDAL 1.11 in this example because it is currently
included by default in Linux repositories and also comes bundled within
QGIS.
