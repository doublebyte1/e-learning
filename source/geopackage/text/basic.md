# Basic GeoPackage Concepts

## Identifying a GeoPackage

A [GeoPackage](http://geopackage.org) is an [SQLite
Database](http://sqlite.org/index.html) file with a [.gpkg
extension](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#r3). If you are unsure
whether a file is an SQLite database, you can use a binary or text
editor to view the starting bytes of the file and see if they state
[\"SQLite format 3\"](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#r1).

## Opening a GeoPackage

There are a number of ways to open a GeoPackage.

-   For using a command-line SQL interface, consider the \"sqlite\"
    command ([SQLite](apps/sqlite.html)).
-   For using a graphical SQL interface, consider [DB Browser for
    SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).
-   For using a web application, consider using [NGA\'s
    application](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-js/) as long as
    the GeoPackage file isn\'t too big.
-   For using a desktop application, there are a number of options. We
    recommend choosing the GeoPackage implementation that is best suited
    for your operational environment. One open source alternative is
    [QGIS](apps/qgis.html).
-   There are a number of GeoPackage APIs including the following:
    -   [GDAL / OGR](apps/gdal-ogr.html)
    -   [The GeoPackage-Java library](apps/geopackage-java.html)

The GeoPackage community tries to maintain a list of operational
GeoPackage implementations and this list can be found on the
[implementations page](http://www.geopackage.org/implementations.html).
Additional information on specific products and versions of products
that implement GeoPackage can also be found at
<http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products>. You can search by
specific versions of the GeoPackage standard. Note: Search for all
implementing products.

## Creating a GeoPackage

Similarly, if you wish to create a new GeoPackage from scratch or from
an existing source file such as a ShapeFile or .csv, below are some
suggestions:

-   For using direct SQL access, start with the [empty geopackage
    template](http://www.geopackage.org/data/empty.gpkg)

-   For using a desktop application, refer to the implementations list
    above

-   For using a command line program, consider the
    [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) vector and raster utilities

-   This [blog
    post](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/working-with-geodata/) (The
    section titled \"Creating a GeoPackage with Reference Data\")
    provides an example that describes steps for creating a GeoPackage
    using ogr2ogr. The post also provides information on how to add the
    [SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index)
    extension to enable further spatial analysis in SQLite.

    > Note: For maximum interoperability, start your database
    > identifiers (table names, column names, etc.) with a lowercase
    > character and only use lowercase characters, numbers 0-9, and
    > underscores ([\_]{.title-ref}).

## Checking a GeoPackage Version

Using a direct SQL interface such as DB Browser is the easiest way to
check a GeoPackage version. SQLite uses [\"pragma\"
statements](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html) to implement
non-standard SQL functions. These statements can be executed just like
any other SQL statement and where relevant, they return a result set.
The two pragmas you need to know are:

-   

    [PRAGMA application_id]{.title-ref}

    :   -   1196444487 (the 32-bit integer value of 0x47504B47 or
            [GPKG]{.title-ref} in ASCII) for GPKG 1.2 and greater
        -   1196437808 (the 32-bit integer value of 0x47503130 or
            [GP10]{.title-ref} in ASCII) for GPKG 1.0 or 1.1

-   

    [PRAGMA user_version]{.title-ref}

    :   -   For versions 1.2 and later, this returns an integer
            representing the version number in the form MMmmPP (MM =
            major version, mm = minor version, PP = patch). Therefore
            1.2 is 10200.

## Running the Executable Test Suite

The [GeoPackage Executable Test
Suite](https://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine/) (ETS) is a
conformance test suite that verifies the structure and content of a
GeoPackage data container. To run the ETS, do the following:

1.  Open the site (linked above).
2.  Create an account using the link provided.
3.  Log in.
4.  Create a new session.
5.  Choose the GeoPackage 1.2 specification (or later if available).
6.  Provide a file using either the URL box or a file upload.
7.  Select the \"Start\" button.

The ETS is open source software hosted in a [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-gpkg12).
