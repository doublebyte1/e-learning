# Attributes and Extensions

## [Attributes](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#attributes)

Attributes are tables that only contain non-spatial data. The rules for
attributes are similar to those for features, but attributes have no
geometry column and the corresponding row in `gpkg_contents` has a
`data_type` of \"attributes\". This data is commonly joined with spatial
data as required by an application.

## [Extensions](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#extension_mechanism)

In addition to tiles, features, and attributes, GeoPackage has a
well-defined extension mechanism to support use cases that are not part
of the core standard. A GeoPackage extension is a set of one or more
requirements clauses that either profiles / extends existing
requirements clauses in the GeoPackage standard or adds new requirements
clauses. Existing requirement clause extension examples include
additional geometry types, additional SQL geometry functions, and
additional tile image formats. New requirement clause extension examples
include spatial indexes, triggers, additional tables, other BLOB column
encodings, and other SQL functions.

Files that use one or more extensions are by definition Extended
GeoPackages. There are two categories of extensions, *registered* and
*community*.

### [gpkg_extensions](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#extensions_table_definition)

The extensions table describes the extensions that are in use in a
GeoPackage. The columns for this table are:

-   `table_name` is the name of the SQLite table where the extension
    applies
-   `column_name` is the name of the SQLite column (in the referenced
    `table_name`) where the extension applies (in some situations this
    is *null*)
-   `extension_name` is the case sensitive name of the extension that is
    required, in the form `<author>_<extension_name>` (the author name
    *gpkg* is reserved for OGC adopted extensions)
-   `definition` is permalink, URI, or reference to a document that
    defines the extension
-   `scope` is either *read-write* (for most extensions) or *write-only*
    (for extensions that can be used seamlessly by applications that are
    unaware of the extension as long as they operate in a read-only
    mode)

### Registered Extensions

Registered extensions have been reviewed and adopted by OGC and are for
all intents and purposes part of the standard. Most registered
extensions are published as part of the [core
standard](http://www.geopackage.org/spec130/#registered_extensions) but
they may be published independently as well.

The following extensions have been adopted by OGC:

-   [Non-Linear Geometry
    Types](extensions/nonlinear_geometry_types.html)
-   [RTree Spatial Indexes](extensions/rtree_spatial_indexes.html)
-   [Zoom Other Intervals](extensions/zoom_other_intervals.html)
-   [Tiles Encoding WebP](extensions/tiles_encoding_webp.html)
-   [Metadata](extensions/metadata.html)
-   [Schema](extensions/schema.html)
-   [WKT for Coordinate Reference Systems](extensions/wkt_for_crs.html)
-   [Tiled Gridded Coverage
    Data](extensions/tiled_gridded_coverage_data.html)
-   [Related Tables](extensions/related_tables.html)

Follow the links for a description for each individual extension.

### Community Extensions

OGC acknowledges that there are use cases not covered by the GeoPackage
standard. Implementers are welcome to use the extension mechanism
defined here to develop community extensions. The extension mechanism
provides advantages including discoverability (the extensions in use can
be discovered by scanning a single table) and uniformity (declaring that
an extension is in use indicates that a defined set of requirements are
being met). However, this is a decision that should be made carefully as
custom extensions do introduce interoperability risks. OGC manages a
registry of [community
extensions](http://www.geopackage.org/extensions.html#_community_extensions).

OGC is unable to endorse community extensions. Therefore an Extended
GeoPackage containing community extensions will not pass conformance
tests. However, a community of interest MAY waive that requirement in
its own GeoPackage profile, with the caveat that it must bear the
responsibility of endorsing the new extension(s).

Implementers that are interested in developing their own extensions are
encouraged to contact OGC to ensure that the extensions are developed in
accordance with OGC policies and in a way that minimizes risks to
interoperability. OGC will consider adopting externally developed
extensions that address a clear use case, have a sound technical
approach, and have a commitment to implementation by multiple
implementers.
