# GeoPackage - Introduction

## Introduction

The GeoPackage Encoding Standard describes a set of rules and
conventions for storing vector features, imagery tile matrix sets,
raster map tile matrix sets and non-spatial tabular data in an
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org) database. The standard also describes rules
for extending the capabilities of a GeoPackage.

History

:   GeoPackage 1.0 was approved as a standard in January 2014.
    GeoPackage 1.1 was approved as a standard in August 2015. GeoPackage
    1.2 was approved as a standard in August 2017. GeoPackage 1.3 was
    approved as a standard in November 2020.

Versions

:   1.3 is the current latest version

Test Suite

:   A test suite exists in the [OGC
    repository.](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-gpkg12)

## Usage

GeoPackage is used for storing and accessing:

-   Vector feature data
-   Imagery tile matrix sets
-   Raster map tile matrix sets
-   Non-spatial tabular data
-   Metadata that describes other stored data

## Implementation Summary

-   Implemented in an SQLite database
-   Feature geometry is encoded in Well-Known Binary (WKB) based on the
    OGC standard "Simple Feature Access" ([Part 1: Common architecture
    (OGC
    06-103r4)](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355),
    [Part 2: SQL option (OGC
    06-104r4)](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25354))
-   Supports both vector feature data and tile matrix sets of imagery
    and maps
-   Ideal format for encoding geospatial data where Size, Weight and
    Power (SWaP) are limited

## Relation to other OGC Standards

Due to its XML serialization, [Geography Markup Language
(GML)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/gml) is well suited to geospatial
data exchange across networks. In contrast, GeoPackage is better suited
to storage and random access of geospatial data on a file system.
GeoPackage implements the OGC standard "Simple Feature Access" (see
above) which provides a common way for applications to store and access
feature data in relational or object-relational databases.
